My name is Jameson Gatewood, and I am currently an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student set to graduate in 2026. I didn't always enjoy creating awesome things as much as I do now, though. When I was a junior in high school, I realized I wanted to do more with my time, so I decided, with some help, to set out on a journey to build a go kart. However, this wasn't a regular kart; it was made of 2x4 wood and screws from Home Depot and electric batteries and motors off of Amazon. The project took roughly 16-18 months, and it underwent four different iterations, each being built from the parts of the version before it. I learned how to accept help and guidance, persevere when I had no idea what I was doing, and give entertaining demonstrations when I finished the final two versions. It was this project that really made me fall in love with building and creating, and it is the true pushoff point of all of the other projects you see on this site.

Ladders, an air raid siren, and even makeshift aluminum clamps are fair game for me. I have had the opportunity to learn how to use various pieces of equipment to make these things, such as a waterjet, lasercutters, all kinds of wood tools, welding equipment, and more. These tools are housed in the Invention Studio at Georgia Tech, where I work as an electronics master whose job is to maintain the space and have an in-depth knowledge of the tools there such as oscilloscopes, power supplies, and waveform generators. It is my great pleasure to teach and assist users of the makerspace how to use these tools and how to best accomplish their own projects as well. I greatly enjoy teaching and keeping spaces tidy, so I am very thankful for the position and community of makers I am surrounded with because of it.
