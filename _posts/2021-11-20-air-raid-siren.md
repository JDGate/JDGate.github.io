This is my air raid siren project, built in the woodroom at the Invention Studio at Georgia Tech. I came up with the siren out of a desire to simply use the amazing woodroom I now had available to me, so I went online and searched for cool woodworking websites. I found [this one](https://woodgears.ca/machines.html), made by a guy who has done many projects. One of them was an air raid siren, and I thought that was really cool. So, I estimated the parts in AutoCAD, cut them out of plywood using a waterjet, and glued them together in the woodroom. I used an old motor from my go-kart project in the project, and I am very happy with how it turned out!
